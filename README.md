Hybrid Mobile Apps semester project using React Native to create a system and it's documentation

## Protection system "Shield protection"
This system is designed to control data which includes users, protected objects, activity logs (login logs) as well as to see a sleepy cat...

Idea of the system is that it's part of 2 application system and this one is deployed at the office or central location. Because of that system allows users to create accouts, add locations and check critical data like location information, user info, protected objects and so on. The second part of application isn't related to the same project (writen in java on Android studio) but allows users to check general data as well as select objects they are protecting at the moment and mark them as finished or worked at and so on. Communication between these projects is created via Firebase.firestore() database as permanent or direct connection isn't required just to see and manage various data related to protection assignments.

More indepth look in this project and it's specifications is in *.docx document added to the project.
